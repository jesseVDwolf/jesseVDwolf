### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesse van der Wolf. I use this github account to upload fun hobby projects
I'm working on. Do not expect everything on this account to be production ready ðŸ˜„.

My interests are mostly in data related engineering. In this repository you're
likely to find the following tools used:
 * Docker
 * Python
 * C/C++

I also have an account where I upload all my study related projects which have tests
and are a little more robust. Check it out if you want to see what I'm currently studying:
